This repository contains the scripts used in the manuscript "Sex-Specific Graphs: Relating Group-Specific Topology to Demographic and Landscape Data".

Containing two sensitivity analyses:

1) Sensitivity_Ae; R code for performing the sensitivity analysis reported in the manuscript "Sex-Specific Graphs: Relating Group-Specific Topology to Demographic and Landscape Data". The code calculates variability in genetic diversity estimates (Ae; Kimura & Crow, 1964) through different scenarios of sampling intensities.

2) Sensitivity_Topology; R code for performing the sensitivity analysis on topology reported in the manuscript "Sex-Specific Graphs: Relating Group-Specific Topology to Demographic and Landscape Data". The code calculates variability in eigenvector centrality scores through different scenarios of node removal. Note that this code could also be applied on different network metrics such as conditional genetic distance (cGD; Dyer et al., 2010).
